# Overview of A/B testing
The primary purpose of A/B testing is to make data-driven decisions that lead to improved user experiences, enhanced performance metrics, and ultimately better business outcomes.

# Description of project
"A/B testing to determine user preference between dark mode and light mode themes on the company's website."


# The detail of all the columns to know:

Theme: dark or light
Click Through Rate: The proportion of the users who click on links or buttons on the website.
Conversion Rate: The percentage of users who signed up on the platform after visiting for the first time.
Bounce Rate: The percentage of users who leave the website without further interaction after visiting a single page.
Scroll Depth: The depth to which users scroll through the website pages.
Age: The age of the user.
Location: The location of the user.
Session Duration: The duration of the userâ€™s session on the website.
Purchases: Whether the user purchased the book (Yes/No).
Added_to_Cart: Whether the user added books to the cart (Yes/No).

# A/B Testing Results
1. Conversion Rates
Test Metrics: Conversion rates based on purchases from both themes.
Z-Statistic: 0.8531
P-Value: 0.3936

Conclusion:
The Z-statistic indicates a slight difference in conversion rates between the Light Theme and the Dark Theme, with the Light Theme performing marginally better.
However, the p-value of 0.3936 is significantly higher than the commonly used significance level of 0.05.
This suggests that the difference observed is not statistically significant, meaning that the variation in conversion rates could be due to random chance rather than a true difference between the themes.

2. Session Duration
Test Metrics: Session duration from both themes.
T-Statistic: 0.3528
P-Value: 0.7243

Conclusion:

The T-statistic shows a small difference in average session duration, with the Light Theme having a slightly higher duration.
The p-value of 0.7243 is much larger than the significance level of 0.05, indicating that this difference is not statistically significant.
This means that the observed variation in session duration is likely due to chance rather than a real effect of the themes.

# Conclusion
From the A/B testing conducted, both the Light Theme and the Dark Theme show minor differences in performance metrics such as conversion rates and session duration. However, these differences are not statistically significant. This implies that there is no strong evidence to prefer one theme over the other based on the current data.
